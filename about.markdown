## Hi there,

For tests and for to listen music together with my colleages I plan to distribute the Xamarin App into the Apple Store. 
Apple needs a web page that contains the privacy policies. In addition to the privacy policies I can configure there further urls for support or marketing purposes.

To do this, I was looking for an easy way to publish content to the internet.

This site is the result of an almost endless investigation to post content into that internet.
- It's the entry point to my repositories.
- It contains "hopefully one day" more content than what currently is available.

The site was created with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)  and...

Cheers Uwe
