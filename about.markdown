## Hi there,

For testing purposes and to listen to music together with my colleages I plan to distribute the Xamarin App into the Apple Store. 
Apple needs a web page that contains the privacy policies. In addition to the privacy policies, distributors can configure further urls for support or marketing purposes there.

To do this, I was looking for an easy way to publish content on the internet.

This site is the result of an almost endless investigation to post content into the internet.
- It's the entry point to my repositories.
- Hopefully it will contain more content one day than what is currently available.

Ahhh... last but not least.
The site was created with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)  and...

Cheers Uwe
